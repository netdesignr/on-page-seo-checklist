## On-page Search Engine Optimisation Checklist
### Schema
   - Confirm what series we need to apply this to (WO 372, PROB 11)
   - Identify what information can be included in the schema
### Keywords
   - Identify the keywords to rank for.
   - Include the target keyword in the first 100 words of the article/content. 
   - Include keyword at the beginning of the article/content.
   - Wrap target keyword ( or a synonym ) in an h1 tag.
   - The keyword or synonym is in an H1 tag.
   - H2 and H3 tags.
      - Include the keyword once in an H2 or H3 subheading. 
### Title
   - Google puts more weight on words found at the beginning of the title tag. 
   - Length 50 - 60 characters
   - Modifiers to the title tag
      - Add modifiers like “2018″, “best”, “guide”, and “review” to help rank for long tail versions of the target keyword.
   - Power words like Today, Right now, Fast, Works quickly, Step-by-step, Easy, Quick, Simple
**Description** 
   - Length 120 - 158 characters.
**Image optimization**
   - Tag the images with keyword-rich alt text. 
**SEO Friendly - URLs**
   - Short URLs that include the target keyword.
**Outbound links**
   - Include at least 2 outbound links to related authority sites (popular blogs, news sites and .edu and .gov resources) in every piece of published content.
**Loading speed**
   - Google PageSpeed Insights tool to figure out the site’s loading speed. 
**Social sharing buttons**
  - Social sharing buttons are front and center on blog posts and articles. 
**Long content**
   - At least 1500 words for content that we’re trying to rank for competitive keywords 
**Bounce** 
   - Include internal links at the top of the article/page. 
**Use LSI keywords**
   - LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) keywords are words that are commonly found alongside your target keyword. e.g. archive inspire = `archives unlocked`, `the national archives about`, `archives strategy`, `the national archives about us`, `national archive at Kew`, `national archives exhibition`, `how to use the national archives`, `national archives discovery`
**Dwell time**
   - Write long, engaging content that keeps people reading. Put a lot of effort into making the first paragraph interesting and compelling. 
**Internal Linking**
  - Add 2-3 internal links to older articles when publishing a new one. 
**Optimize click to content**
  - Make sure high-priority pages are no more than 3 clicks away from the homepage.  
**Maximize CTR**
  - If the users rarely click on the page in Google’s search results, it sends a VERY strong signal to Google that we’re not a good fit for that keyword. And the opposite is also true: if users' cursors are attracted to your site like a magnet, Google will give the page a rankings boost.
